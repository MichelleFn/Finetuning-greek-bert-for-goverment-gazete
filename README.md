# Finetuning-greek-bert-for-goverment-gazete
The above code is the implementation of a binary classification problem for categorizing responsibilities and structures for Government Issued Gazettes using the pre trained model greekBert. To run the code clone the repository and load the python file into a Google Collab or jupyter notebook, the path of the csvs files will need changing.

csv: The used datasets.</br>
fek: The pdfs of the gazettes that have been parsed.</br>
results_dataset2: screenshots of the results from the second dataset.</br>
Binary_text_classification_.ipynb: the classification code.</br>
extract_pdfs: the parser for the gazettes.</br>
